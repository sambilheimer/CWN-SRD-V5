# Hacking

The hacking rules for this game presume a largely hardwired world. Wifi connections are trivially cracked by modern cryptography and cyberdecks have field projection units that can penetrate computer housings or cyberware to reach the wires within. Important installations are kept on isolated local networks and connected to wide-area networks only at pre-arranged and unpredictable intervals. As a consequence, it is necessary for hackers to physically infiltrate most facilities in order to perform their duties.
