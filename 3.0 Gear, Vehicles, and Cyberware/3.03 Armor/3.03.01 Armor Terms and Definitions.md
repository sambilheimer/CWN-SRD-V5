# Armor Terms and Definitions

### Ranged AC:

The Armor Class target for ranged attacks against the wearer. Both ranged and melee AC is always modified by the target's Dexterity mod.

### Melee AC:

The Armor Class target for melee attacks against the wearer.

### Damage Soak:

The amount of hit point damage the armor can absorb before allowing damage through to the wearer. Damage Soak cannot protect against injury that armor could not normally lessen. Damage Soak ablates during combat and refreshes to full after each fight.

### Encumbrance:

The number of encumbrance points the armor adds. Armor must be Readied to be useful.

### Trauma Target Mod:

This modifier is added to the wearer's Trauma Target for purposes of determining Traumatic Hits. A normal human's base unarmored Trauma Target is 6.

### Obviousness:

Subtle armor can pass for ordinary streetwear and can be worn in polite social circumstances without drawing remark. Obvious armor is clearly intended for combat and will make onlookers think the wearer is expecting imminent trouble.

### Cost:

The usual price for the armor through its normally-accessible channels. Some armor is restricted for public sale and will require an appropriate Contact to buy or some mission-generated opportunity.
