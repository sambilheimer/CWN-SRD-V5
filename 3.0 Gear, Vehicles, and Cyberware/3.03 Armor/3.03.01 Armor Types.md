### Armored Clothing:

The bulky plates and heavy ballistic weaves of this outfit are disguised as drapes and fashion elements.

### Heavy Armored Suit:

A head-to-toe suit of interlocking plates and impact absorption units, these suits are reserved for high-end response teams and military operations.

### Impact Jacket:

Built to absorb the impact of various contact sports, extreme athletic pursuits, and unguided vehicle races, these jackets usually come as part of a full-body protective outfit.

### Light Armored Suit:

Ordinary law enforcement and security guards will be wearing suits like this, usually brightly emblazoned with their corporate affiliation.

### Medium Armored Suit:

Heavy security usually sports armor on this level, including police rapid response teams.

### Ordinary Clothing:

Some bold, impoverished, or highly fashionable people still insist on wearing clothing that has no functional use as armor.

### Plated Longcoat:

An ankle-length coat, robe, or mantle is used as a substrate for numerous reinforced plates and swaths of ballistic weave. It’s heavy, bulky, and blatant, but it can absorb a lot of punishment.

### Reinforced Clothing:

Subtle polymer sheets and reinforced weaves are used to provide a modicum of protection in this clothing without sacrificing taste.

### Reinforced Longcoat:

Long, draping clothing is bolstered with advanced fabrics and discreetly-placed absorption plates, the whole remaining deniable as armor.

### Street Leathers:

Fashionable, aggressive, and often mismatched, “street leathers” seldom have any non-synthetic leather in their makeup, but are light and comfortable enough to wear as a habit.

### War Harness:

An upgraded form of street leathers, these outfits have sacrificed all discretion for whatever spare ballistic plates and advanced polymer weaves its owner can sew or bolt on. It’s usually the best armor that local gangs or common thugs can afford.
