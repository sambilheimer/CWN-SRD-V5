# Common Wages

Sometimes the PCs need to hire some extra help, or the GM needs to know what a reasonable wage would be for some NPC. The table below gives the average daily earnings for various types of workers and elites.

Hirelings will carry out their duties with reasonable levels of loyalty, but most won’t risk their lives or face opposition that threatens their destruction. Bodyguards will act to defend their employers, but only the best will stick around in the face of overwhelming opposition. Ordinary street thugs and hired gangers will be willing to commit acts of extreme violence against enemy gangs or helpless civilians, but few of them have any interest in fair fights under other circumstances.
