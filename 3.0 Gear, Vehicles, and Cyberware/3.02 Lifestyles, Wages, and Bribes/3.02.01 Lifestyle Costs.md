# Lifestyle Costs

Living costs money. Every operator needs to make room in their budget for rent, soyburgers, and gang protection payments, and failing to find the money for these things will add a load of stress to the PC.

The table below describes common lifestyle costs and the maximum System Strain modifiers that apply while a PC is living such a life. These modifiers come into effect as soon as a PC starts paying – or not paying – for a given lifestyle level.

Operator teams who obtain their own property or headquarters and make their own deals for local support may be able to lower or eliminate these lifestyle costs at the GM’s discretion.

| Cost/Month | Lifestyle                                                            |
