# Bribe Costs

Bribery is a commonplace in any organization of consequence, and it’s widely accepted that anyone with authority will use it to make a certain amount of side profit. While technically forbidden, everyone expects that cash will obtain faster service, forgiveness for minor offenses, or access to restricted areas.

Serious bribery is for favors beyond that line. Favors that could cause problems for a superior, cost the official their job, or buy them trouble with someone else are going to cost far more, if they’ll do it at all.

The bribe costs on the table below are expressed in multiples of the target’s daily wage, as it costs more to bribe a manager than a janitor. Particular like or dislike for the PCs can move the price accordingly.

| Favor                                       | Bribe Multiple |
| :------------------------------------------ | :------------- |
| Look the other way at a minor infraction    | x2             |
| Pass out information they shouldn’t         | x2             |
| Do a small favor within their authority     | x5             |
| Turn a blind eye when it might make trouble | x14\*          |
| Turn a blind eye when it will make trouble  | x60\*          |
| Do a favor that could have minor backlash   | x30\*          |
| Do a favor that might get them punished     | x90\*          |
| Do a favor that might get them fired        | x180\*         |

\* This is a serious risk, and many NPCs will need reasons beyond simple cash to agree to it
