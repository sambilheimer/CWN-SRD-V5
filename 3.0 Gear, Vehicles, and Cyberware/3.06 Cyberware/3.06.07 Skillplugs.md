# Skillplugs

Commonly-available skillplugs can be found for any skill at level-0 or level-1. A basic Skillplug Jack I system can only interface with intellectual skills that require only modest physical expertise; Know, Fix, or Heal could qualify for this, but Shoot, Exert, or most forms of Perform would not. Such physical skills require an upgraded Skillplug Jack II unit.

Someone with a plug jack and the Skillplug Wires implant can make use of rare, costly level-2 skillplugs, or the vanishingly rare level-3 plugs. Level-3 plugs are normally only available through special missions to obtain them.

Whenever the user rolls a natural 2 on a skillplug-augmented skill check, or a natural 1 on a skillplug-augmented attack roll, the check or roll is an automatic failure that no reroll ability can save. The skillplug jack itself then locks up uselessly for the scene.

While it is possible to implant multiple plug jacks and use multiple skillplugs at once, the increased neural crosstalk invariably increases the chance of severe error. Each additional skillplug run after the first increases the automatic failure roll range by one point.
