# Concealing and Detecting Cyberware

Most conventional cyber has one of three different levels of blatancy. Its signatures are usually restricted to the body part augmented, but obvious neural or internal organ work is usually plain on the user’s skin.

Medical-rated cyber is completely concealed from surface-level inspection, and cannot be detected without a cyber scanner or a medical examination.

Touch-rated cyber is inobvious to mere visual examination, but a person who touches the augmented limb, skin, or other organ will immediately recognize the signs of cybernetic modification.

Sight-rated cyber is so blatant that anyone who looks at the affected body part can see that some form of augmentation has been done. Baggy clothing may suffice to conceal it, but even the most perfunctory patdown will detect it.

Ordinary investigators may not recognize the specific cyber, but experienced operators and other cyber-versed examiners can usually get a good idea of what’s under a person’s skin, often recognizing the specific model of cyber by its signature telltales.

Cyber that produces obvious bodily changes is likewise obvious when it is being used.
