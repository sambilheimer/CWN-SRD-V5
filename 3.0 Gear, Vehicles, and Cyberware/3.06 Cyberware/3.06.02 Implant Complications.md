# Implant Complications

If a surgery results in a complication or cyberware removal damages the tech, the following table is used. If the resulting complication somehow does not apply to the cyber, it counts as a result of 12.

| d12 | Complication                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| :-- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Unreliable: The first time each day that it's important that the system function, roll 1d6; on a 1, it's nonfunctional until it receives maintenance.                                            |
| 2   | Inefficient: The ware incurs an additional 0.5 System Strain cost.                                                                                                                               |
| 3   | Loud: When the system is operating, it's loud enough to be heard clearly five meters away, making stealth impossible. Systems that are always on make this noise constantly.                     |
| 4   | Fussy: The required interval between maintenance is halved.                                                                                                                                      |
| 5   | Bad Connection: Each time the cyberware is triggered, there's a 1 in 6 chance it fails to activate and the action is wasted. Cyberware that is always on is not hindered by this.                |
| 6   | Blatant: Cyberware that normally requires Medical or Touch detection now becomes obvious on sight, perhaps due to excessive scarring or required surface-mount support.                          |
| 7   | Debilitating: Pick an attribute in some way relevant to the cyber. The attribute suffers a 1d2 point penalty to its base score that persists as long as the system remains implanted.            |
| 8   | Uncooperative: Add 1 System Strain if this isn’t the only implant of the same category, such as Limb/Nerve/Body.                                                                                 |
| 9   | Complicated: The complexity of the installation increases the minimum skill level required to maintain it to either Fix-1 or Heal-1.                                                             |
| 10  | Exhausting: Maintenance on the system is exceptionally taxing. After it's done, the user needs to spend 24 hours of downtime resting; if they omit this, they gain 2 System Strain immediately.  |
| 11  | Power Hungry: The user needs to supplement the system by plugging into an urban power grid or vehicle power port for a half-hour each day. Without this, the system goes inert until re-powered. |
| 12  | Petty Annoyance: It has some small quirk or deficiency of fit that causes no real problem in its functionality.                                                                                  |
