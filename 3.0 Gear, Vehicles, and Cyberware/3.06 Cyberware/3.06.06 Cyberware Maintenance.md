# Cyberware Maintenance

A cyberware system's maintenance and subscription expenses add up to 5% of the cyberware’s base cost due monthly, not including any cyberware mods or implant surgery expenses. The maintenance work itself takes a number of hours equal to the System Strain of the system, to a minimum of fifteen minutes, and must be performed by someone with at least Fix-0 or Heal-0. Maintenance supplies can be purchased almost anywhere cyberware is available, and any reasonable dollar amount of them can be carried as 1 Encumbrance item.

If a system goes more than a month without upkeep, it starts to malfunction. The GM rolls or picks an implant complication and applies it to the system until it receives maintenance. Very extended lack of maintenance can provoke chronic illnesses or death. Some ultra-high-end bespoke ware may absolutely require timely maintenance if their complex systems are not to stop operating entirely.
