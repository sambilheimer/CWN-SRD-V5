# An Introduction from the Site Manager

Hi. This site is a repository of the System Reference Document (SRD) for Kevin Crawford's cyberpunk TTRPG **Cities Without Number**. The SRD is a free, open-source, and public domain document that describes the rules and mechanics of the game.

[Character Creation](character-creation/) is a guide to creating a character for the game.

[The Rules of the Game](rules-of-the-game/) is a guide to the rules of the game.

[Gear, Vehicles, and Cyberware](gear-vehicles-cyberware/) is a guide to the gear, vehicles, and cyberware available in the game.

[Hacking](hacking/) is a guide to the hacking rules of the game.

Note that I've left out some optional rules from the SRD, such as rules about magic and spellcast, and also left out the section on Antagonists & NPCs. This site is intended for my players, and those won't be relevant at this time. I'll add them later if/when I have time.
