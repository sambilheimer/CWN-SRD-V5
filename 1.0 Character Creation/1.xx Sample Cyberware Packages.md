# <span id="page-30-0"></span>Sample Cyberware Packages

Players who take the _Wired_ Edge can pick from the cyberware options starting on [page 62](#page-65-1). This long list can be somewhat overwhelming to new players, however, especially if they don't know exactly how all these choices might affect their PC in play.

To simplify things a few example packages are provided below, along with an explanation of how they might work during play. PCs can always add to these choices, up to the Edge's \$200,000 maximum budget, but remember that every additional piece of cyber is that much more to repay if you ever want to refund _Wired_ for a different Edge.

Each package is listed with the total System Strain it adds to your PC. This total cannot exceed your Constitution. If your character has a weak Constitution and can't handle a package's System Strain, you should consider adding a \$20,000 _Cybernetic Infrastructure Baseline_ system as described on [page 66](#page-69-0).

Packages also list the monthly maintenance costs for the cyber. The _Wired_ Edge pays for the first two months of maintenance, but after that it's on you to find enough work to support your chrome.

| Cutter                                                          | Cost    | SS  |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- | --- |
| Body Blades II: 2d6 dmg, Shock<br>4/15, Trauma 1d10/x3          | \$25K   | 2   |
| Enhanced Reflexes I: 1/scene get a<br>bonus Main Action         | \$100K  | 2   |
| Dermal Armor I: AC 16 vs. melee<br>and ranged, +1 Trauma Target | \$40K   | 1   |
| Total                                                           | \$165K  | 5   |
| Monthly Maintenance                                             | \$8,250 |     |

A classic choice for close-in brawlers and professional assassins, this package gives you powerful melee blades, higher resistance to unlucky Traumatic Hits, and a bonus action each fight for close-in rushes.

| Gunner                                                             | Cost    | SS  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------- | --- |
| Gunlink: Ignore aim penalties, reroll<br>a gun miss 1/scene        | \$25K   | 1   |
| Enhanced Reflexes I: 1/scene get a<br>bonus Main Action            | \$100K  |     |
| Cybereyes with Infrared Vision:<br>Flash protected and infra-sight | \$15K   |     |
| Total                                                              | \$140K  | 3.5 |
| Monthly Maintenance                                                | \$7,000 |     |

You're not as durable as a melee specialist, but you're more likely to hit with your _Gunlink_ cyber and enhanced vision. You'll want to find the best gun you can get and keep out of reach of melee attackers.

| Hacker or Driver                                               | Cost    | SS   |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- | ---- |
| Cranial Jack: Can plug directly into<br>jack-enabled hardware. | \$1K    | 0.25 |
| Neural Buffer: Gain 3 HP/level<br>versus neural hacking damage | \$40K   | 1    |
| Headcomm: Provides silent radio or<br>cell communications      | \$1K    | 0.25 |
| Remote Control Unit: Remote con<br>trol drones or vehicles     | \$10K   | 2    |
| Total                                                          | \$52K   | 3.5  |
| Monthly Maintenance                                            | \$2,600 |      |

You might already have a free _Cranial Jack_ if you picked the _Hacker_ Edge, and PCs who only plan on driving or piloting drones might drop the _Neural Buffer_. As cheap as this package is, some users might add some combat cyber such as a _Gunlink_ or _Enhanced Reflexes_.

| Sneak                                                               | Cost    | SS  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- | --- |
| Cybereyes with Infrared Vision:<br>Flash protected and infra-sight  | \$15K   | 0.5 |
| Stick Pads: Can cling to or climb<br>sheer surfaces or overhangs    | \$15K   | 0.5 |
| Cyberears w/Positional Detection:<br>Noise protection+position loc. | \$25K   | 0.5 |
| Total                                                               | \$55K   | 3.5 |
| Monthly Maintenance                                                 | \$2,750 |     |

Flashbangs are melee weapons to you, and you don't need light to track guards or find a way over a wall. You have room in your budget for more cyber, but you don't want to be scouting alone when a fight starts.

| Techie or Doc                                                                                             | Cost    | SS   |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- | ---- |
| Omnihand: +1 skill check once/<br>scene for technical work                                                | \$10K   | 0.25 |
| Skillplug Jack II: Can use level-1<br>physical or mental skill plugs                                      | \$25K   | 0.5  |
| Skill Plugs: Level-1 skill plugs for any<br>desired skill, \$10K for mental<br>skills, \$20K for physical | -       | -    |
| Total                                                                                                     | \$35K   | 0.75 |
| Monthly Maintenance                                                                                       | \$1,750 |      |

An _Omnihand_ is of no use for surgery, but it's a convenient multi-tool for a tech. Skillplugs can be bought with _Wired_ funds, but remember that you can only run one at a time with a single skillplug jack, and installing more than one jack increases the risk that a plug will lock up as explained on [page 64.](#page-67-0) -->
