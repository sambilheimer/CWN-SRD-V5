# Attributes

A character has six attributes ranging from 3 to 18, reflecting a range from the minimum viable capacity for a playable character to the maximum normal human level.

## What Each Attribute Affects

| Attribute    | Affects                                                               |
| :----------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Strength     | Physical prowess, melee combat,<br>carrying gear, brute force         |
| Dexterity    | Speed, evasion, manual dexterity,<br>reaction time, combat initiative |
| Constitution | Hardiness, enduring injury, tolerating<br>large amounts of cyberware  |
| Intelligence | Memory, reasoning, technical skills,<br>general education             |
| Wisdom       | Noticing things, making judgments,<br>reading situations, intuition   |
| Charisma     | Commanding, charming, attracting<br>attention, being taken seriously  |

NPCs do not normally have attributes. If necessary, the GM can choose them as appropriate, but usually they are assumed to have average scores if it’s ever relevant.

## Generating Attributes

To generate their six attributes, the player rolls 3d6 in order, once for each attribute. At any point before section 1.5.0 in character creation the player may substitute a score of 14 for one rolled score.

Optionally, a player may choose to assign their stats from the following array of numbers: 14, 12, 11, 10, 9, and 7, divided up as desired among the attributes. If an array is used a score may not be substituted with a 14 later.

## Attribute Modifiers

Each attribute has a modifier, usually ranging from -2 to +2. This modifier is added to skill checks, attack rolls, damage rolls, Shock damage, and the relevant saving throw targets.

Some Foci and cyberware may add bonuses or penalties to an attribute’s base modifier. Such bonuses or penalties cannot increase the modifier above +2 or below -2 unless explicitly indicated. Some injuries or character advancements may alter an attribute score; this new score may change the attribute’s modifier.

| Attribute Score | Modifier |
| :-------------- | :------- |
| 3               | -2       |
| 4—7             | -1       |
| 8—13            | +0       |
| 14—17           | +1       |
| 18              | +2       |
