# Contacts

Contacts are associates the PC has acquired in their past life or potential new acquaintances they make during play. Contacts come in two levels: acquaintances and friends. Acquaintances will deal honestly with the PC, do favors for them that don't put them at risk or significant expense, and perform their professional skills on the PC's behalf. Friends will also do as much, but will undertake favors that cause them considerable risk or significant expense. Contacts will not normally go on missions with the PCs.

## Initial Contacts

A new PC begins play with either two acquaintances or one friend of their choice. The player should give a name to each, a brief description of their profession, and a sentence or two about how they developed the relationship. Starting Contacts should not be elite figures or major players in the setting, but capable mid-level NPCs who can provide services and favors. Some examples would include a local cyberdoc, a black-market arms dealer, a popular club owner, an HR officer at a local megacorp branch, or similar sorts.

## Gaining and Losing Contacts

Contacts can be gained and lost during play. When a PC acts in such a way as would reasonably earn a particular NPC's friendship and trust, the GM may tell the player to note that NPC down as an acquaintance or friend. In the same fashion, if the PC burns or abuses a relationship, it may downgrade a friend to an acquaintance or cost them the connection entirely. Contacts exposed to danger by a request or favor may also be killed if events turn out poorly.

To create contacts, follow these steps:

1. Give them a name.
2. Give them a sentence of physical description.
3. Give them a sentence describing what they do that might be useful to an operator.
4. Write a line or two about how you met them.

The tables below give suggestions as to what kind of Contacts might be appropriate and some ideas as to how you came to know them. You can create your own with the GM's permission, assuming they're about the same degree of importance and influence. Contacts should be useful, but not major figures of importance.

You can call on a particular Contact once per game session. Acquaintances will do business with you at usual market rates, but are trustworthy within reason and will do you favors that don't cost them much. Friends will do significant favors and take on substantial personal risk, but expect to be treated as actual friends and not mere minions. As a general rule, Contacts won't go on missions with the PCs.

## <span id="page-18-0"></span>One-Roll Contact Tables

If the example contacts on the prior page don't spark your imagination, you can use this one-roll table to sketch out the basics of your operator's friend. You can either take one die of each type and roll them all at once, reading the entries from the tables accordingly, or you can pick directly from those items you know you want to include.

Once you've taken one item from each table, stitch them together in a way that makes sense to you. For example, if you roll someone who moves in street circles and can do cyberdoc work for you, it's pretty likely you know a street doc. The "What Can They Do For You?" table should be taken as a general measure for what a Contact can accomplish, but they can also do other things that fit within their basic concept or role.
