Every new operator has managed to buy, beg, borrow, or scrounge a certain amount of equipment to support their new career. Without the right gear, even the most promising young hope is likely to have a quick, unpleasant end.

A novice PC has \$500 to purchase gear from the equipment tables starting on [page 50,](#page-53-1) plus one single item worth no more than \$1,000, such as a rifle for a hitman, a scrap cyberdeck for a hacker, or some other tool of their trade. Their recent work has been profitable enough to have paid for one month of a middle-class lifestyle as explained on [page 51](#page-54-0). After that month, they're on their own for making rent and avoiding poverty.

Those with Foci such as _Drone Pilot_ or _Ace Driver_ that grant free equipment can also choose vehicles and fittings from the appropriate sections of the book starting on [page 76](#page-79-1) and [page 82,](#page-85-1) with the budget for a first-level character given on [page 18.](#page-21-1)

If you don't care to spend the time shopping the equipment tables, a new operator can pick one of the packages below, perhaps swapping out an item or two at the GM's discretion. The value of the packages tends to be a little higher than simple starting cash to reflect their more limited flexibility. PCs with Foci such as _Drone Pilot_ can still pick their Focus gear in addition to this starting package.
