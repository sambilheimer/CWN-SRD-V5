# Backgrounds

Every character has a Background, a past reflecting their career before they took up adventuring. A background may be chosen from the list below or a new one made up with GM permission.

## Backgrounds, Skills, and Growth

When a Background is chosen, a PC immediately gets its free skill at level-0. At that point, the player decides whether to gain further skills randomly or to pick specific choices.

If they choose randomly, they may make three rolls divided between the Growth and Learning tables of their background in any way they wish, including taking all three from just one table. If they pick specific choices they can pick any two skills from the Learning table, including picking the same one twice to raise it to level-1. They may not pick the "Any Skill" option, if it exists.

A skill pick of "Any Combat" means the player can pick Shoot, Stab, or Punch. A skill roll of "Any Skill" means they can pick any skill from the list above. Some campaigns may involve special magical or psychic skills; these cannot be chose with the Any Skill pick.

If an attribute bonus is rolled, such as "+2 Physical", the player may apply it to any physical attribute or split the bonus between two physical attributes. The same principle applies to Mental attribute increases. "Any Stat" increases may be applied to either physical or mental attributes. No attribute can be raised above 18.

## New Backgrounds

To create a new background, the player describes it to the GM and picks an existing background table that best fits the concept. Assuming the GM approves it, they may then roll or pick as usual. If no existing background table fits, they may make a new one with the GM's permission.

## d20 Background List

The following backgrounds are examples of those possible for a player. The free granted skill is listed after each background's name.

<!--
Once you pick a background, your operator gains several skills associated with their past.

First, you get the free skill associated with the background. Every member of that role or profession needs this skill to function competently, so your operator gets it as well.

Next, you may either pick two other skills from the Learning table for your background, or make three random rolls divided between the Growth and Learning tables. If you pick skills, you can select exactly the talents you want for your hero, while going with random rolls allows your character a little wider range of competence and the option of attribute improvements at the cost of perfect control over their development. If you pick skills, you may pick the same skill twice if you wish, to improve its starting proficiency.

If you're not sure what to pick, just take the two skills listed under "Quick Skills" for your background. They're the ones most critical to the profession.

If you're making up a custom background and want to roll randomly on the Growth and Learning tables instead of making specific picks, either pick existing tables that best fit your concept or make up some new ones with the GM's approval. -->

<!-- ## Training Skills and Attributes

When your character is allowed to pick or roll a skill, you learn it at level-0 expertise the first time you receive it. If you receive it a second time, it becomes level-1. If some mechanic or skill choice allows or obliges you to pick it a third time, you can instead choose any other skill in its place.

_No operator can start with a skill level above level-1._ No matter how many different ways you get a skill pick, level-1 is the maximum starting skill level.

Sometimes you're allowed to pick "Any Skill". This means you can choose any skill to improve. Other entries that read "Any Combat" mean that you can pick either Stab, Shoot, or Punch as you choose.

Rolls on the Growth table that improve your basic attributes can boost them up to a maximum of 18. A bonus that applies to "Any Stat" can be applied to any attribute. If the roll says to add the bonus to Physical attributes, you can add the bonus to either Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution. If the roll says to add a bonus to your Mental attributes, you can apply the points to either Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma. If the bonus is +2, you may split the points between two different attributes of the appropriate type if you wish.
