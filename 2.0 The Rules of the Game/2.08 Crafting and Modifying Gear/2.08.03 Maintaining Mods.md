# Maintaining Mods

Mods normally require maintenance to keep functioning correctly, and a given tech can maintain only so many mods at once. A tech can only maintain mods they have the requisite skill levels to build; if a tech has Fix-1 and the mod requires Fix-2 to build, they can't maintain it.

A tech's maximum maintenance score is equal to the total of their Intelligence and Constitution modifiers plus three times their Fix skill level. Thus, a tech with a +1 Intelligence mod, a -1 Constitution mod and Fix-1 could maintain up to three mods at any one time.

Maintenance is assumed to take place during downtime and does not require any significantly expensive components. If a tech does nothing but maintain mods, they can double their allowed number. Such work assumes sixteen-hour workdays.

If a mod goes without maintenance for 24 hours, it stops working. If it goes without maintenance for a week, the item it's attached to stops working. A maintenance backlog on an item can be cleared by an hour's work by a tech capable of maintaining it.
