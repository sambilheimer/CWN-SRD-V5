# Factory Mods

Some corporate brands, product lines, or special prototypes may come with certain mods pre-engineered into the device. Sometimes these mods are flat upgrades, while other times they come with certain disadvantages or weaknesses in the gear to compensate.

Such gear usually sells at a premium. The device's cost is usually increased by at least five times the mod's build price, and each unit of special components that are required for its mods doubles the device's total price.

These factory mods do not require maintenance. If a tech further mods the gear, however, the delicate balance of engineering in it is disrupted, and the factory mods begin to require maintenance as normal.

The availability of factory-modded gear depends on the campaign and the connections of the PCs. Some might be relatively available for those with the money, while other items might require special contacts or private information to obtain.
