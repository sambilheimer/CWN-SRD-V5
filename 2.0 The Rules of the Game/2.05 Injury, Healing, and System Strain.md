# Injury, Healing, and System Strain

Injury is almost inevitable in an operator's career. Some forms of it can be longer-lasting than others.

<!-- The medical technology of most cyberpunk settings can allow humans to survive injuries that would be certain doom in other genres. Even so, such synthetic vitality comes at a cost.

# <span id="page-43-3"></span>Mortal Wounds and Stabilizing

A creature reduced to zero hit points by a lethal attack is dead or dying. Ordinary NPCs or unremarkable creatures will generally die on the spot. PCs and those NPCs important enough to have deserved a name will be _Mortally Wounded_.

A Mortally Wounded creature is helpless, unable to do anything but scream, writhe, or lie unconscious. At the end of the sixth round after they were downed, they will die. They will die instantly if they take any further hit point damage.

An ally can attempt to stabilize a Mortally Wounded companion. Doing so is generally an Int/ Heal or Dex/Heal skill check, one requiring a Main Action.

The difficulty for this skill check is 8 plus the number of full rounds since the target was downed. If the medic lacks a medkit, the difficulty for this skill check is increased by 2. Only one ally can try to stabilize a target in any given round, though others can attempt to aid their skill check, and a failed check can be re-attempted the next round.

Once stabilized, the target recovers with 1 hit point after ten minutes of rest, and can rise and act normally thereafter. They count as _Frail_, however, and will remain Frail until they have had at least a week of bed rest. Frail PCs cannot heal damage through natural healing and will die immediately if brought to zero hit points again.

A medic can try to remove the Frail condition with a medkit, an hour's work, and a skill check against difficulty 10. They only get one chance to remove a given Frailty.

# Natural Healing

A wounded creature can recover some measure of strength and vitality with a good night's rest. Provided they are fed, warm, and reasonably comfortable, a non-Frail creature will recover their character level or hit dice in HP each morning.

Frail creatures do not regain HP through natural healing, requiring a full week of bed rest and the regular care of a medic with Heal-0 skill and a medkit in order to shake the condition. Those without this level of care must make a Physical save after a week; on a failure, they die in the next few days, while on a success, they need another month of recovery to lose their frailty.

# First Aid

Modern combat medicine can work marvels, provided the user isn't worried about the long-term carcinogenic qualities of the drugs or their unfortunately frequent psychological side-effects. Few operators concern themselves with such irrelevant details.

By spending a few minutes tending an ally, a medic with a medkit can heal 1d6 HP of damage on a target, plus their Heal skill level. If they have no Heal skill at all, they roll 1d6-1 instead. Each such application adds one System Strain to the target.

A single application of first aid takes one minute of mission time. First aid can restore hit points to a Frail target, but cannot get rid of the Frail quality.

# <span id="page-43-1"></span>System Strain

A given human body can withstand only so much biochemical manipulation at once. Healing, cybernetic implants, certain poisons, some diseases, or even natural privation and hardship can all build up _System Strain_ in a subject.

A character's maximum System Strain is equal to their Constitution attribute. Thus, someone with a Constitution of 13 could accumulate up to 13 points of System Strain. This strain is usually lost at a rate of one point for every night of good, refreshing sleep.

Healing often adds to a target's System Strain, whether as first aid or as the effect of some biomedical compound. If the target is already at its maximum System Strain, it can't handle the additional stress and gets no benefit from the effect or attempting healing.

Cyberware implants also usually permanently increase a subject's System Strain. Points earned by implants or other permanent modifications cannot be shed; they remain until the implant is removed. Particularly harsh or opulent lifestyles can also modify System Strain maximums, as given on [page 51](#page-54-0).

# Poisons and Diseases

Most toxins force a victim to make a Physical saving throw to resist their effects or mitigate their harm. Weak perils might grant as much as a +4 to the saving throw, while dire threats might apply a -4 penalty.

If the save is failed, the poison or disease takes hold. Most poisons act quickly, inflicting hit point damage, adding System Strain to the target, or applying long-lasting penalties. Diseases can have a slower onset but often apply the same sort of harms.

A medic who gets to a poisoned person within a minute of the poisoning can use a medkit to give them a better chance to resist. They may add twice their Heal skill level to the victim's saving throw roll, or +1 if they have only Heal-0 skill. Specialized antitoxins may be able to neutralize such poisons entirely. -->
