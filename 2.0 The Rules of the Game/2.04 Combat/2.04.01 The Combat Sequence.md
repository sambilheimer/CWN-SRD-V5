# The Combat Sequence

When combat begins, the fight progresses in the following sequence. The sections below explain each step in the process.

First, each participating side rolls for initiative. The side that rolled highest acts first.

Second, each member of a side gets to take their actions. Members of a side act in whatever order they wish. NPC sides act in whatever order the GM wishes.

Third, once every member of a side has acted, the side that rolled next-highest gets to act. If NPCs have taken losses or are facing defeat, they may need to roll a Morale check as explained in section 5.2.0. PCs never check Morale.

Fourth, once every side has acted the process repeats from the top in the same order. Initiative is not re-rolled.

<!-- # The Combat Round

Once the guns come out, a fight shifts into _combat rounds_. A round generally lasts six seconds, and a full fight is considered to count as one scene for the purposes of tracking special ability usage or other abilities that can only be used once per scene.

## The Combat Sequence

When combat begins, the engagement follows a set sequence of events.

1. If one side is completely surprised and not expecting any danger, their opponents get a free full round of actions before moving to step 2. People on active alert for danger cannot be surprised under normal circumstances.
2. Each side rolls initiative, rolling 1d8 plus the side's best Dexterity attribute modifier, if they have any. The side that rolls highest goes first, and then the others in order. PCs win ties.
3. Each member of the side gets a turn to act. PCs can act in any order the group finds agreeable. NPC sides act in whatever order the GM thinks is reasonable.
4. During a turn, a person can take one Main Action, one Move action, and as many On Turn actions as the GM thinks is plausible. Instant actions can be taken at any time, even during someone else's turn or after a roll has been made. Common actions are listed on [page 34.](#page-37-1)
5. If a combatant moves away from a foe in melee without taking a _Fighting Withdrawal_ action, each enemy in melee gets a free out-of-turn attack against them as they turn and flee the fight.
6. Once every member of a side has acted, the next side acts. If they've taken losses or are facing defeat, they may need to make a Morale check to keep fighting, as explained on [page 183](#page-186-1). PCs never check Morale.
7. When all sides have had their turn, the round is over and the sequence repeats from step 3. Initiative is not re-rolled.

## Making An Attack

To make an attack, spend your Main Action and follow the steps below.

1. Roll 1d20 for your attack. Add your base hit bonus, your weapon's relevant attribute modifier, and your relevant combat skill. Good gear or special situations may add modifiers
2. If your total equals or exceeds your target's appropriate Armor Class, you inflict damage. Ranged attacks target ranged AC and melee attacks target melee AC. A natural 1 on your attack roll is always a miss and a natural 20 is always a hit, if a hit is physically possible.
3. If you hit, roll your weapon's Trauma Die, possibly modified by special abilities such as the _Killing Blow_ Edge. If the roll equals or beats their Trauma Target you've inflicted a Traumatic Hit as explained on [page 37](#page-40-1).
4. If you hit, roll your weapon's damage dice and add its relevant attribute modifier. Unarmed hits using the Punch skill can also add that skill level. If you've inflicted a Traumatic Hit, multiply the total by the weapon's Trauma Rating.
5. If you miss, and your weapon's Shock rating is equal or higher than their Armor Class you still inflict Shock damage as explained on [page](#page-39-1) [36.](#page-39-1) Normally, only melee weapons have a Shock rating.
6. If you inflict Shock damage, it's equal to your weapon's base Shock plus the weapon's relevant attribute modifier plus any damage modifiers that explicitly add to Shock like the _Killing Blow_ Edge. Shock never causes Traumatic Hits.
7. Subtract the damage you inflicted from the target's hit points, taking them from their armor damage soak (if any) before harming the wearer. If they're reduced to zero hit points they're either dead, mortally wounded, unconscious, or stunned and helpless depending on what kind of mayhem you inflicted on them. See the rules on [page 40](#page-43-3) for handling downed PCs and foes.

A successful hit doesn't always represent a direct impact on a target; it might be a glancing blow, a bullet that forces them to duck, or a tax on their luck. Lethal attacks that really do bring a PC down to zero hit points indicate an actual physical injury. -->
