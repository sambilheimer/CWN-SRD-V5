# Special Combat Maneuvers

There are certain special maneuvers or activities that commonly arise in combat.

## Shoving and Grappling

To shove a target the attacker must make a successful melee attack. This attack does no damage, but forces an opposed Str/Exert or Str/Punch skill check. If the attacker wins, the target is shoved back up to 3 meters or knocked prone at the attacker's discretion.

To grapple, the attacker must make a successful unarmed melee attack while having both hands free. This attack does no damage but forces an opposed Str/Punch skill check. If the attacker wins, the victim is grappled. A grappled victim remains so until they take a Main Action to perform a successful opposed Str/Punch skill check against their assailant.

While grappled, neither the assailant or the target can move from their location, nor can they fight with anything but unarmed attacks, including Body Blades cyber or similar body-mounted weaponry. At the end of each round, a grappled victim automatically suffers damage as if hit by their assailant's unarmed attack.

If the attacker wishes to move the grappled target, they must spend a Main Action and make an opposed Str/Punch skill check. On a success, they move the target up to 3 meters along with them or throw them 2 meters and leave them prone. On a loss or tie, the target escapes.

An attacker can grapple only one target at a time, but a defender can be grappled by multiple assailants, within reason. Any skill checks forced on a multiply-grappled target are compared against all assailants, and win only if all assailant rolls are beaten.

These rules assume both assailant and target are relatively human-sized. Grappling or shoving humanoid but substantially larger targets is done with a -2 penalty on all skill checks, while trying to handle quadrupeds or those only barely plausible to wrestle is done at a -4 penalty.

## Dual-Wielding Weapons

Some attackers prefer to use two weapons at once. PCs who wish to do so must have at least level-1 in the relevant weapon skills, such as Stab-1 and Shoot-1 for dual-wielding a knife and pistol.

When making an attack while dual-wielding, the attacker chooses which weapon they wish to use, rolling the attack roll accordingly. On a hit, the weapon does +2 damage so long as the target is within range of both wielded weapons. This bonus does not add to Shock.

Managing two weapons at once is difficult, and applies a -1 penalty to all hit rolls.

## Execution Attacks

A target that is entirely unsuspecting of damage is subject to execution attacks. A subject that is expecting danger or alert to potential harm cannot be targeted by an execution attack.

A ranged execution attack requires one full minute of aiming, waiting, and adjusting on the part of the would-be sniper. Any disturbance during this time will spoil the shot. After spending this time, the assassin may make a Dex/Shoot skill check. The difficulty is 6 for an attack within two meters, 8 for an attack within the weapon's normal range, or 10 for one at the weapon's long range. On a success, the attack hits; the victim's Armor Class is ignored.

A melee execution attack requires one full minute of near proximity to the target, watching for just the right opening and getting to within melee range of the victim. If this time is granted, the assassin may make a melee attack, automatically hitting.

When a target is hit with an execution attack they must make a Physical saving throw at a penalty equal to the assailant's combat skill. On a failure, they are immediately reduced to zero hit points and Mortally Wounded, or knocked unconscious if the weapon was non-lethal.

If they succeed on the save, they still take damage normally. Successful execution attacks always count as Traumatic Hits, so the ensuing multiplied damage or Major Injury may be enough to kill the victim anyway.

<!-- # <span id="page-41-0"></span>Examples of Combat

To help new readers understand how combat might play out in their campaigns, a few example encounters are provided here. The operator team involved in them has two members, both first level PCs.

# Calculating Combat Information

As an illustration, let's walk through the process of recording the combat stats for a couple of example first-level operators.

_Duchess_ is a stealth and technical expert. She's not heavily invested in combat expertise, but she has the basic tools for self-defense; she picked the Tech starting equipment package on [page 25.](#page-28-1)

The package gives her a light pistol. Her hit roll bonus with the gun is equal to her base hit bonus of +0, then +1 for her Dex modifier, since Dexterity is the attribute used with light pistols, and then +1 for her Shoot-1 skill, for +2 total.

The gun's base damage is 1d6, to which she adds +1 from her Dex modifier, for 1d6+1 total. It has a Trauma Die of 1d8, which she rolls alongside each attack. If it equals or exceeds the target's Trauma Target on a hit, they take x2 damage from the Traumatic Hit.

She's also got a knife. Her hit bonus with it is +0 base, +1 from Dex as a knife can use either Dex or Str modifiers, and then -2 because she lacks even Stab-0 skill for a total modifier of -1. She's not exactly an expert knife fighter.

The knife's damage is 1d4, +1 for her Dexterity modifier, for a total of 1d4+1. Its Trauma Die is 1d6, and it does x3 damage on a Traumatic Hit. Being a melee weapon, it also does Shock damage; her Shock with it is 1 for the weapon's base value, +1 for her Dexterity mod, for a total of 2. She inflicts it on anyone with AC 15 or less when she misses an attack on them, so if her enemy is lightly-armored it can be worth her while to try to stab him even with her poor knife skills.

Being a novice operator with 1d6 hit points, Duchess ended up with a roll of 3. Since even a knife does 1d4 damage, it behooves her to avoid fighting where she can, and if she can't, to make sure she sets it up to her advantage.

Duchess didn't get any armor with her starting gear package, so she has to settle for ordinary clothing. Thus, her melee and ranged Armor Class are both equal to 10, the base value, +1 for her Dexterity, for a total of 11.

_Morton Fuller_ is an ex-City Records Department clerk who found a new career as a cybernetic street merc after failed mandatory productivity neurosurgery. While he suffers from severe issues with longterm memory and hypothetical event modeling, he has absolutely no problem dismembering people with the body blades he bought with his _Wired_ Edge. While he lacks Duchess' practical skills, he's a fearsome brawler.

He's taken the Cutter starting cyberware package with his _Wired_ funds, which equips him with a _Body Blades II_ system. His hit bonus with it is +0 base, +1 for his Str bonus, since the blades can use either Str or Dex, +1 for his Punch-1 skill, for a total of +2.

His damage is 2d6 plus his Str modifier, plus one for his _Killing Blow_ Edge, for 2d6+2 total. It has a 1d8 Trauma Die, +1 for _Killing Blow_, for 1d8+1 total, and a x3 multiplier on a Traumatic Hit. Compounding that, it has a base Shock of 2, +1 from Strength, +1 from _Killing Blow_, for 4 points against AC 15 or less. Most ordinary thugs are going to get eviscerated by Mort even on a missed hit roll, unless they're armored or abnormally tough.

Mort took the Badlander gear package, as he doesn't really need any melee weapons, and the rifle in the package looked useful in case the fight is outside melee range. Unfortunately, Mort is clumsy, with a -1 Dexterity mod, and has absolutely no skill with firearms. His hit bonus is +0 base, -1 Dex, and -2 for no Shoot skill, for -3 total. His damage with it is 1d10+2 base, -1 for Dex, +1 for _Killing Blow,_ for 1d10+2 total. Its Trauma Die is 1d8, +1 for _Killing Blow_, for 1d8+1 and a x3 multiplier.

His _Dermal Armor_ cyber system gives him a base Armor Class of 16 versus melee and ranged attacks, modified by -1 for his Dex modifier. At least the system gives him a +1 bonus to his Trauma Target, from the base 6 to 7, making it harder for him to suffer a Traumatic Hit.

While Mort is a walking engine of monomolecular death, he still has 1d6 hit points, +1 for his Con modifier. In his case, that's 3 points. He can reduce a corp security guard to a red smear in a heartbeat, but a pistol round that gets past his dermal armor is probably going to put him down. If he's prudent, he won't give a gunman that chance.

# A Sudden Brawl

Morton and Duchess are having a discussion with three members of the Salt Boys when Duchess lets slip that they're working with the gang's arch-rivals. The furious gangers reach for their guns and combat begins.

Both sides roll initiative, rolling 1d8 plus their best Dex modifier. For the PCs, that's Duchess with her +1 Dex. They roll a 5. Unfortunately, the gangers roll an 8. Being NPCs, they don't usually have any Dex modifier, but 8 is still enough to win initiative. The gangers get to act first.

Morton can't afford to let that happen, so he takes a _Snap Attack_ action. This special action lets him attack right now, out of initiative order, though it costs him his next Main Action and applies a -4 penalty to his hit roll.

<span id="page-42-0"></span>Morton doesn't care. He can see these thugs are wearing nothing heavier than street leathers, and his Shock damage is sure to go through even on a miss. As it turns out, he rolls a 16, +2 for his hit bonus, -4 for the _Snap Attack_, for a final total of 14. The street leathers the gangers are wearing have a melee AC of 12, so he hits.

Morton rolls 2d6+2 for damage, and a 1d8+1 Trauma Die at the same time. The damage dice roll a 9 and the Trauma Die rolls 6. That's enough to make a Traumatic Hit, so the damage is multiplied by the blade's x3 rating, for 27 points of damage.

Street leathers have a damage soak of 3 points, absorbing the first 3 points of damage the wearer takes in each fight. Unfortunately, the thug's 3 hit points then absorb the following 24 points of damage. The GM decides that there's no way the ganger is living even a moment after that kind of slaughter, and describes the way Morton neatly bisects the goon horizontally. If it were lighter overkill or the ganger were someone important, he might've made it out as merely Mortally Wounded, dying in a few rounds if no one helped him.

Duchess considers taking a _Snap Attack_ too, but she's within melee range of the gangers, so they'd be able to get up in her face and apply a further -4 penalty to her pistol's hit roll. She'd have almost no chance of hitting with that, so she holds off and waits her turn to act.

Since one of their comrades has just died horribly, the gangers need to make a Morale check. They need to do this the first time an ally dies, when half their number are down, or when some terrifying event happens on the battlefield. The GM rolls 2d6 and gets an 8, comparing it to the gangers' Morale score of 7. It's over, so the gangers break. Being undisciplined fighters, they simply turn tail and move to flee back down the alleyway.

Unfortunately, one of them is still within melee range of Morton. Because the ganger is running all out and not taking a _Fighting Withdrawal_ action, Morton gets a free attack against him as he turns his back. Mort rolls a 2, however, missing the thug. His 4 points of Shock damage still applies, however, erasing the damage soak of the thug's street armor and inflicting 1 point of damage on the ganger. He had 5 hit points, so he escapes with a long gash across his back.

It's now the PC's turn. Duchess pulls her pistol and squeezes off a round at a fleeing thug, rolling 10, +2 for her hit bonus. That's enough to hit the thug's ranged AC 12. She rolls 5 points on the pistol damage, but her Trauma die comes up 7, hitting the thug's base Trauma Target of 6 and doubling the damage. The thug's damage soak can't save him, and he goes down, Mortally Wounded and dying.

Mort took a Snap Attack, so he's lost his Main Action for the round. His target is 20 meters away, having fled last round. What can Mort do to catch him before he lets the Salt Boys learn about their betrayal?

He can activate his _Enhanced Reflexes I_ cyber as an On Turn action, gaining a point of System Strain and a bonus Main Action as he explodes into neurostimulated motion. He uses the _Charge_ combat action, spending his Main and Move actions to close with his fleeting target and attack.

The GM doesn't even bother asking him to roll to hit, because his Shock damage alone is going to be enough to kill the thug. Now all the operators have to do is hide the bodies and hope nobody affiliated with the Salt Boys saw their little disagreement.

# A Rooftop Sniper

Duchess and Mort have been pinned down by a sniper perched on a nearby building. Mort's passed his rifle over to Duchess, since she's the better shot, and she's given him her pistol. Both are hunkered down behind a dumpster, and they don't have much time before gang reinforcements show up. With a few hurried words, they make a hasty plan as their turn comes up.

Mort acts first. He's got the better armor, so he makes a wild rush across the alley to the corner of the building nearby, leaning around it to blaze away at the gunman with his pistol in a _Swarm Attack_ supporting Duchess. His covering fire has got no chance of hitting, but his _Swarm Attack_ gives Duchess a +2 hit bonus and a +1 damage bonus on his target.

Duchess then leans around the dumpster, aims the rifle, and is about to pull the trigger when the sniper realizes his peril. He's an expert gunman, so the GM decides he's skilled enough to pull off a _Snap Attack_ at Duchess. The GM decides that the two gunners fire simultaneously.

Duchess rolls a 13 on the hit roll, +2 for her hit bonus, +2 for the _Swarm Attack_, hitting the sniper's ranged AC 15 plus his +2 bonus for being in partial cover. She rolls 1d10+3, +1 for the _Swarm Attack_, for 12 points of damage. Her Trauma Die only comes up a 1, so no Traumatic Hit was inflicted. Even so, 12 points of damage is enough to kill the sniper.

Unfortunately, the sniper's _Snap Attack_ still goes through, and the deceased ganger rolls a modified 14, +3 for his hit bonus, easily hitting Duchess' AC of 11, +2 for partial cover. His rifle rolls 8 points of damage, reducing Duchess to 0 hit points and Mortally Wounding her. At least there was no Traumatic Hit.

With combat over for the moment, Mort rushes to her side and fumbles with the Trauma Patch he got with his starting kit. He can stabilize her with an Int or Dex/Heal skill check at difficulty 6. Unfortunately, the best of those attributes for Mort has a -1 modifier, and he has no Heal skill, so he takes a further -1 modifier. He rolls 2d6 and gets a 7; at -2, that's not enough for the patch to work.

Now Mort is without medical tools, without skills, and with only 5 more rounds to plug the hole before Duchess bleeds out in a dirty alleyway. If she lives, she may choose to adjust her risk thresholds. -->
