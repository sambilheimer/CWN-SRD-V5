# Attack Rolls in Combat

When an assailant makes an attack, they roll 1d20 and add their base attack bonus, the weapon's relevant attribute modifier, and their relevant combat skill level. If they lack even level-0 in the appropriate combat skill, they apply a -2 penalty to the roll. If the total is equal or greater than the target's relevant Melee or Ranged Armor Class, they hit. If less, they miss.

Every weapon listed in section 3.4.0 is listed as using one or more attributes, such as either Str or Dex for a knife. The attacker may choose either attribute for modifying the weapon's attack and damage rolls.

## NPC Attack Rolls

NPCs usually do not have attribute modifiers or skill levels. Instead, the attack bonus of a trained NPC combatant is usually equal to their hit dice, often with an additional bonus to reflect particularly good training or talent.

## Attack Roll Modifiers

Some common situations can modify an attack roll, granting a bonus or penalty. GMs may add others depending on the situation. Attackers with the Gunlink cybersystem ignore 2 points of penalty applied by cover or concealment, and do not suffer penalties for long range firing.

| Circumstance                                                                    | Mod |
| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :-- |
| The target is prone and not in melee range.                                     | -2  |
| The target is prone and adjacent.                                               | +2  |
| Your target is past your gun's normal range, up to its maximum long range.      | -2  |
| You are prone and trying to make a melee attack.                                | -4  |
| The target is at least half behind cover.                                       | -2  |
| The target is almost complete behind cover.                                     | -4  |
| You are making a thrown attack while in melee with someone.                     | -4  |
| You are shooting a one-handed gun while in melee with someone.                  | -4  |
| You are trying to shoot a two-handed gun while in melee with someone.           | N/A |
| You are shooting at a target you can't see but you know where they are.         | -4  |
| You are shooting at a target you can't see and don't know their exact position. | N/A |

<!-- When the clock's not ticking and an operator has all the time they need to accomplish something, it doesn't matter how long it takes to do it. They can tell the GM what they want to do, and the GM will tell them how much time they need for their efforts.

In combat and other high-pressure situations, however, things become more tense, and time is usually tracked in _combat rounds_. A person can only accomplish so much in a six-second round, and this section explains how to measure those frantic efforts.

# #Types of Actions

PCs and other creatures in combat or time-sensitive circumstances get a certain number of actions they can take each round.

_Main actions_ include making an attack, executing a hack, manipulating an object, complex maneuvers, and anything else that the GM thinks shouldn't take more than six seconds to do. A combatant gets one Main action each round.

_Move actions_ allow the subject to move up to their full Move rate, which is 10 meters for a normal human. Some actions that are too complex for On Turn actions but not demanding enough for Main actions might also be Moves, such as picking up an object or standing up from prone. A combatant gets one Move action each round, but can spend their Main action as an additional Move if they wish.

_On Turn actions_ are quick, simple acts that take no more than a moment of time and no real concentration. Speaking a few words, falling prone, or triggering certain cyber systems might all be On Turn actions. A combatant can make as many On Turn actions in a round as the GM thinks is reasonable; a quick shout is fine, but a lengthy soliloquy may not be acceptable.

_Instant actions_ are responses so quick that they can be performed at any time, even during another person's turn. Instant actions can even be triggered after dice have already been rolled. Only certain abilities are Instant actions, like the _Veteran's Luck_ Edge or the activation of certain cyber systems. A combatant can trigger as many Instant actions as they have available, up to the limit of what the GM finds plausible. If multiple Instant actions are triggered in response to each other they are resolved in the order the GM finds most logical.

## Example Actions

The following actions are some of the most common that operators and their foes will undertake while under fire. Other unlisted possibilities exist, and a GM should be ready to make on-the-spot decisions about what kind of action an effort will require if the PCs come up with something novel.

#### Make a Melee Attack Main Action

The combatant attacks an enemy within melee range with a fist or Readied weapon, rolling a normal hit roll and inflicting damage on a successful hit. If the attack is unarmed, it can add the user's Punch still to the damage roll, but not the Shock. _Body Blades_ and other body weaponry can use the Punch skill but do not add it to their damage. Most melee attacks inflict Shock damage on a miss, if the target's Armor Class is low enough, and no successful hit does less damage than the weapon's Shock would have done on a miss.

#### Make a Ranged Attack Main Action

The combatant fires or throws a Readied ranged weapon at a target. The combatant can't _Make a Ranged Attack_ with a two-handed weapon such as a rifle if there's a enemy armed with a melee weapon within melee range; it's too easy for the assailant to hinder the use of a rifle. One-handed ranged weapons and thrown weapons can still be used, albeit at a -4 penalty to hit.

#### Make a Snap Attack Instant Action

A combatant with a Ready weapon can rush their attack, sacrificing accuracy for speed. The combatant must still have their Main Action impending or available. As an Instant, they can sacrifice it to make a melee or ranged attack against a foe, whether a snap shot with a bow or a quick thrust at an adjacent melee foe. This attack takes a -4 penalty to its hit roll. If multiple _Snap Attacks_ go off at the same time, they are resolved simultaneously.

Snap Attacks are normally only possible for PCs and other very well-trained or talented combatants. If an opponent isn't significant enough to have been given a name, they probably shouldn't be using _Snap Attacks_.

#### Make a Swarm Attack Main Action

Each assailant takes this action against a target in range of their current weapon, until up to four have done so. When the final participant has taken this action, one of the mob can elect to make an immediate melee or ranged attack against their target, gaining a +2 bonus to hit and +1 to damage for each other surviving attacker, up to +6/+3. This damage bonus does not add to Shock and it cannot drive the attack's damage over the maximum usually possible for the blow, but Shock from this attack always harms the target, even if they have a too-high AC, are using a shield, or have a Focus immunity to Shock. The sheer swarming numbers of foes are bound to inflict some kind of harm on the target provided they're not completely immune to the mob's weaponry.

#### Charge Special

A combatant can make a wild charge before hurling a weapon or crashing into a foe, moving up to twice their normal move in a straight line before making a melee or thrown attack at +2 to hit. The charging attacker must be able to move at least 10 feet to gain momentum and suffers a -2 AC penalty for the round. Charging takes both a Move and Main Action.

#### Screen an Ally Move Action

The PC moves up to their normal Move rate towards an ally and then physically blocks opponents from attacking them, provided they remain within ten feet. Until the PC's next turn, enemies who wish to make a melee or ranged attack against the screened ally must succeed in a successful Str or Dex-based opposed skill check against the PC using the combat skill applicable to their weapon; on a failure, the attack roll is automatically directed toward the screening PC.

A PC can screen against a number of attackers in one round equal to their highest combat skill; thus, Stab-2 lets them block the attacks of two different attackers. PCs with level-0 or worse combat skills can't effectively screen. Multiple PCs can try to screen the same ally; in such a case, the attacker's skill check is compared against all blockers and the lowest-rolling successful blocker is attacked. PCs can only screen against foes and attacks they could plausibly physically parry or block with their bodies. Gunfire cannot normally be screened without integral cyber-armor.

#### Total Defense Instant Action

As an Instant action, the combatant focuses on nothing other than avoiding knives, arrows, bullets, or other perils in the vicinity. Using _Total Defense_ costs the user their Main Action for the round, and cannot be used if they've already employed their Main Action. They become immune to Shock damage for the round, including from _Swarm Attacks_, and gain a +2 bonus to their Armor Class until their next turn.

#### Run Move Action

The combatant moves their normal combat movement rate, which is 10 meters for most humans. If they're engaged in melee combat with an armed foe as they take this action, they need to make a _Fighting Withdrawal_ first as described below or each melee enemy gets a free attack on them as they turn and flee.

#### Make a Fighting Withdrawal Main Action

The combatant disengages from any melee foes around them. They don't actually move away, but they can now move away from their assailants with a Move action without giving them a free melee attack as explained above. Movement taken as part of an _Enhanced Reflexes_ cyberware activation or other hyper-accelerated extra action does not require a _Fighting Withdrawal_ before disengaging.

#### Use a Skill Main Action

The combatant uses a skill that could be plausibly applied in a few seconds. An Int/Heal or Dex/Heal skill check to stabilize a wounded comrade is one such potential use, as is firing up a car's engine, shouting out a stirring rallying cry to timorous NPC allies, or anything else that might be done in six seconds.

#### Ready or Stow an Item Main Action

The combatant draws a weapon, extracts an item from their pack, digs a medical kit out of a belt pouch, or otherwise moves an object around on their person. They can Ready an item this way or Stow it, as explained in the Encumbrance rules on [page 48](#page-51-1).

#### Reload a Weapon Main Action

The combatant reloads a weapon like a pistol or rifle with a Readied magazine or a quarrel from a Readied quiver. Modern bows and crossbows can be reloaded as an On Turn action, assuming the archer has a Readied quiver and Shoot-1 skill; otherwise it's a Move action.

Drop an Item Instant Action

The combatant drops something they're holding. They can do this Instantly at any time to free up their hands.

#### Pick up an Item Move Action

The combatant can scoop an object off the floor if they have a free hand, leaving it Readied in their grip.

Stand Up Move Action

The combatant gets up from a prone position, gathering any dropped belongings. Most characters that have just been revived from unconsciousness must get up before they do much else.

Go Prone On Turn Action

The combatant falls flat, forcing distant ranged attackers to take a -2 penalty to hit them. Adjacent ranged and melee enemies find them an easier target, however, gaining +2 to hit. The combatant's movement rate is halved while prone.

#### Hold An Action Move Action

By choosing to _Hold An Action_, the combatant can delay taking the rest of their actions until later in the round, activating them as an Instant action. Thus, an operator whose side wins initiative might use their Move action to _Hold An Action_. Later in the round, as an enemy rushes around a corner, he may Instantly elect to use his Main Action to _Make A Ranged Attack_ with his readied pistol. If acting in response to someone else's impending action, the held action is resolved first. -->
