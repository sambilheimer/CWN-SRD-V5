# Damage, Trauma, and Shock

If an attack hits, it inflicts hit point damage equal to the weapon's damage die plus the weapon's relevant attribute modifier. Special weapon mods or cyberware may increase this damage.

Some armor provides Damage Soak. Incoming weapon damage is subtracted from this Damage Soak first before it can reach the wearer. Once this Damage Soak is depleted it can give no further protection for the rest of the fight; it refreshes after combat is over to reflect a new chance for the wearer's luck to save them.

## Non-Lethal Damage

You may attack non-lethally with an appropriate weapon or unarmed attack. If so, do not roll the Trauma Die as explained below. Your attacks will only incapacitate the target if you reduce them to zero hit points.

## Punch Weapon Damage

If you are making a purely unarmed attack you may add your Punch skill to the damage. You may not add the skill to the damage done by Body Blade cyber or other artificial weaponry that uses the Punch skill.

## Trauma

When you hit with a weapon or lethally-intended unarmed attack, roll the weapon's associated Trauma Die. If it equals or exceeds the victim's Trauma Target, which is usually 6 for a normal unarmored human, you have inflicted a Traumatic Hit.

Traumatic Hits multiply the total damage of the hit by the weapon's listed Trauma Rating. Thus, if a shotgun with a x3 Trauma Rating would normally have done 9 damage in total, it instead does 27. If this damage or any later damage in the same fight reduces the victim to zero hit points, they risk a Major Injury as described in section 2.5.6.

Some Edges, armor, or cyberware may increase a subject's Trauma Target. Some other abilities might grant a bonus to the Trauma Die roll. To speed the process, it's generally best to roll the Trauma Die at the same time as the attack or damage roll.

Drones, vehicles, and other inanimate objects are immune to Traumatic Hits from weapons that could not reasonably inflict catastrophic structural damage on them. A shotgun may be sufficient to wreck a backpack-portable drone, while it is unlikely to inflict ruin on a car engine. The GM decides on applicability in ambiguous cases.

## Shock

Some melee weapons inflict Shock on a missed attack roll. This damage reflects the inevitable harm a poorly-armored combatant suffers when engaging in armed combat. Shock for a weapon is recorded as a point value and target Armor Class, such as "Shock 2/15". If the wielder misses a target with this weapon that has a Melee Armor Class equal or less than the weapon's Shock rating, they suffer the listed amount of damage anyway. Thus, if that weapon were to miss a victim with Melee AC 13, it would still do 2 points of damage.

Some attacks apply Shock on a miss regardless of the target's Armor Class. This benefit may be granted by certain abilities, or it may be part of a dangerous NPC's talents. Such Shock ratings are recorded with "-" as the affected AC, such as "Shock 5/-". This automatic Shock is still negated by cyber or abilities that grant a subject immunity to Shock.

The only modifiers that add to Shock damage are the wielder's relevant attribute modifier for the weapon and any damage bonuses that explicitly add to Shock. Thus, the Killing Blow Edge adds to Shock because it specifically says so, while a weapon mod that merely says it adds +2 damage would not.

A person using a riot shield or other barrier can ignore the first source of Shock they would normally suffer in a round. Some other Foci or special actions such as Total Defense can also render a subject immune to Shock.

Damage inflicted by Shock cannot cause a Traumatic Hit. An attack that hits can never do less damage than the Shock that would have been inflicted on a miss.

# <span id="page-39-0"></span>Combat Maneuvers and Definitions

The basic combat and attack sequence covers most of what brawlers are going to be doing in a given round of combat, but sometimes the situation gets a little more complicated. When the party team is ambushed in the streets, the cyber-goon wants to pin the group's hacker, or the evening's entertainment has a monomolecular surprise for her client, the details below can be helpful.

# Initiative

When a side rolls initiative, they roll 1d8 and add the best Dexterity modifier among them. NPCs usually have no modifier, though the GM might give one to exceptionally quick or slow NPCs.

The side that rolls highest wins initiative, with PCs winning ties. Groups then act in initiative order, with each member acting in whatever sequence the group thinks best.

If a PC has some cyber or ability that allows them to automatically win initiative, they go first even if their side loses initiative. If two such boosted combatants oppose each other, they act in whatever order the initiative dice indicated.

While initiative by side tends to be fastest and simplest in play, some groups prefer to roll initiative individually, with each combatant rolling 1d8 and combatants acting in order from highest to lowest. As before, PCs win ties. This "individual initiative" option makes it less likely that NPC enemies will all get to go before the PCs, but it does make it harder for a team to coordinate their own actions.

# Cover and Positioning

Prudent combatants tend to take cover during gunfights. The hit roll modifiers below apply in most such cases, though special situations are for the GM to judge.

When multiple penalties are applied for cover or positioning, use only the worst. Otherwise, penalties stack; trying to put a pistol round into a target who has half-ducked around a corner while his friend tries to stab you would have a hit penalty of -2 for half cover and -4 for shooting a pistol in melee for -6 total.

| Situation                                  | Mod |
| ------------------------------------------ | --- |
| Shooting at a distant prone foe            | -2  |
| Attacking an adjacent prone foe            | +2  |
| Melee attacking while prone                | -4  |
| The target is at least half behind cover   | -2  |
| The target is almost completely in cover   | -4  |
| Making a thrown attack while in melee      | -4  |
| Shooting a one-handed gun while in melee   | -4  |
| Shooting a two-handed rifle while in melee | N/A |

# <span id="page-39-1"></span>Shock Damage

Some melee attacks inflict _Shock_, the inevitable harm that is done when an unarmored target is assailed by something sharp in melee range. Shock damage applies only on a miss in combat; on a hit, the weapon does its usual damage.

Shock for a weapon is listed in points of damage and the maximum AC affected. Thus "Shock 2/15" means that 2 points of damage are done to any target with AC 15 or less. More heavily-armored targets are immune to the weapon's Shock.

Assailants add their weapon's attribute modifier to Shock, along with any damage bonuses that are explicitly noted as adding to Shock. Damage bonuses that do not specifically add to Shock are omitted.

An attack never does less damage on a hit than it would do in Shock. Thus, if an attack that would normally do 4 points of Shock to AC 15 hits a target with AC 13 and rolls a 3 for damage, 4 points are done.

Brawlers using a riot shield negate the first melee Shock damage they'd otherwise take each round.

# Shoving and Grappling

To shove a target or force them back, the attacker must first make a successful melee hit, inflicting no damage, and then succeed in an opposed Str/Punch or Str/ Exert skill check. If the attacker succeeds in the skill check, the target is either forced back up to 3 meters or knocked prone at the assailant's discretion.

To grapple a foe, the attacker must first hit with an unarmed attack, doing no damage, and then both must make opposed Str/Punch skill checks. If the attacker wins, the defender is grappled and remains that way until released or until they spend a Main Action and succeed in a new opposed check. An attacker can grapple only one target at a time, though multiple attackers can cling to one defender. In such cases, the defender's skill check is compared against all of their foes.

While grappling, neither attackers or defenders can move from their current location, nor can they fight with anything but unarmed attacks. At the end of each round in which a defender remains grappled, they suffer damage from each attacker as if hit with an unarmed attack from each foe grappling them.

If the attacker wishes to move the target, they must spend a Main Action and succeed in an opposed Str/Punch skill check. If they win, the target is moved 3 meters along with them, or thrown 2 meters and knocked prone. On a loss or tie, the defender escapes.

These rules assume both targets are man-sized. Grappling or shoving significantly larger but still humanoid targets is done at a -2 penalty on all skill checks by the attacker. Doing so to creatures only barely plausible for such wrestling is done at a -4 check penalty.

# <span id="page-40-2"></span>Dual-Wielding Weapons

PCs who want to dual-wield must have at least level-1 in the relevant combat skill; two pistols means Shoot-1, and a pistol and knife mean Shoot-1 and Stab-1 skills. When they attack, they must decide which of their two weapons to attack with; that weapon's modifiers will be applied to their attack roll and Shock rating. Ranged weapons expend ammunition normally for each round of dual-wielding, whether or not the wielder uses them for the attack roll.

Dual-wielding grants a +2 damage bonus on all hits on targets within range of both weapons; if using a knife and gun, this means foes in melee range, while dual pistols could get the bonus on anyone in range of the guns. This damage bonus applies only to successful hits, and not to Shock damage.

Managing both weapons is difficult, however, and all attack rolls made while dual-wielding take a -1 hit penalty.

# <span id="page-40-0"></span>Execution Attacks

Sometimes an assailant has the luxury of a completely unsuspecting victim. An _execution attack_ gives the attacker the opportunity to take them down in a single swift strike, regardless of how tough and heavily-cybered they might be.

A target is only vulnerable to an execution attack if they feel perfectly safe. A guard standing a tedious watch at some quiet post might qualify, but if she knows intruders are present she'd be too alert. A VIP surrounded by bodyguards might feel at ease, but if shots have just been fired, he'll be too alert to danger to be caught sufficiently unawares.

If the target is vulnerable, the would-be assassin must spend a full minute setting up the hit. This may involve carefully aiming their rifle, drifting innocently closer amid a crowd, or watching their bodyguards for a moment of inattention. Any combat or other disturbance during this time will spoil the strike.

Once the hit is set up, the assassin can strike as a Main Action. Melee attacks automatically hit, regardless of the target's Armor Class. Ranged attacks require a Dex/Shoot skill check against difficulty 6 for point-blank shots, 8 for those at normal range, or 10 for one at a weapon's long range. An operator can use the _Veteran's Luck_ Edge with this shot, but it only allows a reroll on a failed check rather than a certain hit.

If the execution attack hits, the target must make an immediate Physical save at a penalty equal to the attacker's combat skill level. If they fail, they are Mortally Wounded on the spot, or knocked unconscious if the attacker was using a non-lethal attack.

If the save succeeds, they still take damage from the attack. Successful execution attacks always count as Traumatic Hits, and the multiplied damage or Major Injury might well be enough to kill the target anyway.

# <span id="page-40-1"></span>Traumatic Hits and Trauma Targets

High-powered weaponry and fragile human bodies do not mix. Sometimes, a particularly unlucky strike can inflict a _Traumatic Hit_.

The odds of a lethal attack inflicting such a hit depend on the target's _Trauma Target_. A normal creature's Trauma Target is 6; this can be modified by cyberware or heavy armor.

Heavy armor and certain cyberware and special abilities can modify the user's Trauma Target. For some weapons, this might mean there's no chance of inflicting a Traumatic Hit. Trauma Target bonuses from different sources stack, so a +1 from the _Hard To Kill_ Edge stacks with the +3 from wearing a suit of heavy armor for a final Trauma Target of 10.

Every weapon has a _Trauma Die_ listed for it along with a _Trauma Rating_ multiplier. When an attack hits a living creature, the assailant rolls this die. If the total is equal or greater than the victim's Trauma Target, it's a Traumatic Hit, and the total damage they inflict with the blow is multiplied by the Trauma Rating.

For example, if Skinny Lou shivs an unarmored troublemaker and rolls a 6 on her knife's 1d6 Trauma Die, she's inflicted a Traumatic Hit. She rolls 1d4 for the knife's damage, adds her +1 Dexterity attribute modifier for the weapon, and adds an additional +2 damage from the custom monomolecular mods her friend installed on it. The total damage is 6, which is multiplied by the knife's x3 Trauma Rating for a total of 18 points of damage. The thug's belly is unzipped in a single smooth stroke and he is no longer Lou's problem.

Non-lethal attacks don't roll the Trauma Die unless the attacker wants to do so, which turns the attack lethal. Unarmed attacks aren't usually at risk of murder, but if somebody wants to bounce a victim's skull off the curb, killing them is a real possibility.

Drones, vehicles, robots, and other large inanimate objects are immune to Traumatic Hits from weapons that could not plausibly inflict real damage on them at the GM's discretion.

Someone brought to zero hit points in the same fight they took a Traumatic Hit runs the risk of suffering major injury, as explained on [page 41.](#page-44-1) This applies even if the Traumatic Hit itself didn't put them down but they were felled by a later injury.

# Less-Lethal Attacks

To make a less-lethal attack, the assailant has to be using a weapon that could plausibly inflict non-lethal damage. Clubs, fists, shock prods, staves, or other weapons would be suitable, while combat rifle rounds would not.

Attackers striking to subdue a target this way make their attacks normally, but do not roll the Trauma Die. Victims brought to zero hit points this way are alive but unconscious, helpless, stunned, or otherwise incapacitated as the assailant wishes. -->
