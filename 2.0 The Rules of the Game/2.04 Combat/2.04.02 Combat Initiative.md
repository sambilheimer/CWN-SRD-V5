# Combat Initiative

When combat begins, each side involved in it rolls initiative, rolling 1d8 and adding their group's best Dexterity modifier. NPCs usually add nothing. The groups then act in order from highest to lowest rolls, with PC sides winning ties. When the slowest group has acted, the round ends and a new round starts in the same initiative order. Members of a side can act in any order the group agrees upon when it is that side's turn to act, performing their allowed actions as explained in the section below.

## Individual Initiative

As an optional rule, the GM may use individual initiative. In this case, each combatant rolls 1d8 individually, adding their Dexterity modifier, and acting in order from highest to lowest with PCs winning ties. This leaves a group less likely to be caught flat-footed by enemies, but makes it harder for a group to coordinate actions.

## Surprise

If a group is caught entirely unawares they may suffer surprise, automatically granting their enemies a full free round of action before initiative can be rolled. The GM decides when surprise applies, possibly calling for an opposed Dex/Sneak skill check versus the target's Wis/Notice. Groups cannot be surprised if they are actively anticipating the possibility of combat; at most, they might suffer an initiative penalty at the GM's discretion.

## Automatic Initiative Powers

A PC with certain Foci or cyberware may be immune to surprise or gain automatic initiative. In such cases they automatically act first during a combat round, even if the rest of their side is slower. If multiple combatants have these powers, they roll initiative normally amongst themselves to see which of them acts first.

<!-- # Actions in Combat

When the clock's not ticking and an operator has all the time they need to accomplish something, it doesn't matter how long it takes to do it. They can tell the GM what they want to do, and the GM will tell them how much time they need for their efforts.

In combat and other high-pressure situations, however, things become more tense, and time is usually tracked in _combat rounds_. A person can only accomplish so much in a six-second round, and this section explains how to measure those frantic efforts.

### Types of Actions

PCs and other creatures in combat or time-sensitive circumstances get a certain number of actions they can take each round.

_Main actions_ include making an attack, executing a hack, manipulating an object, complex maneuvers, and anything else that the GM thinks shouldn't take more than six seconds to do. A combatant gets one Main action each round.

_Move actions_ allow the subject to move up to their full Move rate, which is 10 meters for a normal human. Some actions that are too complex for On Turn actions but not demanding enough for Main actions might also be Moves, such as picking up an object or standing up from prone. A combatant gets one Move action each round, but can spend their Main action as an additional Move if they wish.

_On Turn actions_ are quick, simple acts that take no more than a moment of time and no real concentration. Speaking a few words, falling prone, or triggering certain cyber systems might all be On Turn actions. A combatant can make as many On Turn actions in a round as the GM thinks is reasonable; a quick shout is fine, but a lengthy soliloquy may not be acceptable.

_Instant actions_ are responses so quick that they can be performed at any time, even during another person's turn. Instant actions can even be triggered after dice have already been rolled. Only certain abilities are Instant actions, like the _Veteran's Luck_ Edge or the activation of certain cyber systems. A combatant can trigger as many Instant actions as they have available, up to the limit of what the GM finds plausible. If multiple Instant actions are triggered in response to each other they are resolved in the order the GM finds most logical.

## Combat Maneuvers and Definitions

The basic combat and attack sequence covers most of what brawlers are going to be doing in a given round of combat, but sometimes the situation gets a little more complicated. When the party team is ambushed in the streets, the cyber-goon wants to pin the group's hacker, or the evening's entertainment has a monomolecular surprise for her client, the details below can be helpful.

### Initiative

When a side rolls initiative, they roll 1d8 and add the best Dexterity modifier among them. NPCs usually have no modifier, though the GM might give one to exceptionally quick or slow NPCs.

The side that rolls highest wins initiative, with PCs winning ties. Groups then act in initiative order, with each member acting in whatever sequence the group thinks best.

If a PC has some cyber or ability that allows them to automatically win initiative, they go first even if their side loses initiative. If two such boosted combatants oppose each other, they act in whatever order the initiative dice indicated.

While initiative by side tends to be fastest and simplest in play, some groups prefer to roll initiative individually, with each combatant rolling 1d8 and combatants acting in order from highest to lowest. As before, PCs win ties. This "individual initiative" option makes it less likely that NPC enemies will all get to go before the PCs, but it does make it harder for a team to coordinate their own actions.

### Cover and Positioning

Prudent combatants tend to take cover during gunfights. The hit roll modifiers below apply in most such cases, though special situations are for the GM to judge.

When multiple penalties are applied for cover or positioning, use only the worst. Otherwise, penalties stack; trying to put a pistol round into a target who has half-ducked around a corner while his friend tries to stab you would have a hit penalty of -2 for half cover and -4 for shooting a pistol in melee for -6 total.

| Cover Type          | Hit Penalty    |
| ------------------- | -------------- |
| Half Cover          | -2             |
| Three-Quarter Cover | -4             |
| Full Cover          | -8 (can't hit) |

### Shoving and Grappling

Sometimes combatants want to wrestle, shove, or otherwise physically control their opponents rather than simply hitting them.

**Shove** (Main Action)

A combatant can attempt to shove an adjacent foe. Make an opposed Str/Exert check. If the shover wins, they can push the target back 5 feet or knock them prone. If the target wins, nothing happens.

**Grapple** (Main Action)

A combatant can attempt to grab and hold an adjacent foe. Make an opposed Str/Exert check. If the grappler wins, the target is grappled and cannot move or take actions that require free hands. The grappler can maintain the grapple as a Move action each round, or release it as a free action.

A grappled target can attempt to break free as a Main Action by making an opposed Str/Exert check against the grappler.

### Less-Lethal Attacks

Sometimes operators want to subdue rather than kill their opponents. Less-lethal attacks use the same rules as normal attacks, but they deal non-lethal damage that doesn't cause permanent injuries.

Non-lethal damage is tracked separately from normal damage. When a character takes non-lethal damage equal to their current hit points, they fall unconscious but are not in danger of death. -->
