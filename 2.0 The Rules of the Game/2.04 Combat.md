# Combat

Violence is inevitable in most cyberpunk campaigns. The rules below handle its most common manifestations.

<!--

## The Risks of Violence

Combat tends to kill people. For as predictable as this outcome may be, players can sometimes be shocked and dismayed when their operators turn out to be people, too. PCs need to understand that violence is always a gamble, and prudent operators take care to load the dice as much as possible in their favor.

At low levels, most PCs can be taken out in one good hit. It's up to them to set up their fights so that the opponents don't get the chance to make that hit. Even at higher character levels, a Traumatic Hit from a guard's rifle can easily drop a character who isn't heavily armored, so a degree of caution, prudence, and planning is necessary even for hardened professionals.

Aside from the immediate consequences of gunfire, players also have to keep in mind the longer-term effects. Corporations don't like it when operator teams kill large numbers of expensive security guards, and a team that starts leaving massacres in their wake will climb rapidly up the corporation's hit list. The Heat guidelines on [page 178](#page-181-1) hint at some of the potential consequences for PCs who have messy eating habits.

On the GM's side, it's important to remember that NPCs are people too, and ones who are fully aware of how fragile their own lives are. Corp security guards, city police, and neighborhood gangers may fight, but they're not going to throw their lives away in blind legions. The Morale rules on [page 183](#page-186-1) should always be kept in mind when handling fights, as there aren't a lot of selfless martyrs in a cyberpunk world.

Lastly, a GM needs to keep in mind that the combat threats and violent perils facing the PCs are set by what is logical, not by what is level-appropriate. As explained in the mission creation guidelines on [page](#page-145-1) [142,](#page-145-1) a fight should involve whatever forces would logically be available. If those forces are too much for the PCs to have any chance of overcoming them, the players will need to come up with a less bloody alternative plan.

> ## For SWN and WWN Players
>
> Readers who are already familiar with combat rules for _Stars Without Number_ or _Worlds Without Number_ shouldn't find many surprises in this section. There are only a few major differences to keep in mind.
>
> _People have both melee AC and ranged AC_, and it may be different depending on the type of armor they're wearing. NPCs might have the same Armor Class for both types to keep things simple for the GM.
>
> _Armor sometimes has hit points_, and attacks sap armor damage soak before moving on to the wearer. Armor hit points refresh at the end of a fight, representing the wearer's luck holding out for one more brawl.
>
> _Lethal attacks roll a Trauma Die_, and if the die is equal or greater than the victim's Trauma Target, usually 6, the damage is multiplied by the weapon's Trauma Rating. Lucky shots can be devastating.
>
> _Permanent injuries can happen_ if a target who has taken a Traumatic Hit during the fight reaches zero hit points. See [page 41](#page-44-1) for this potential consequence. -->
